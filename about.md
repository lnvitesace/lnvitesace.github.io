Hello! I'm currently a second-year B.S. student majoring in computer science.

I am an enthusiastic self-learner. Thanks to [Yinmin Zhong](https://yinminzhong.com/),
who shared great self-study resources, I had the opportunity to take part in such interesting courses.
If you are also a self-learner, you can contact me by email and study together! Cool!

I'm also a history buff. As the strongest fighting force in the cold weapon era,
Mongolian history is what interests me the most, even if I am not Mongolian.
History of science is my second interest. Science has shaped human life today.
This is the age of science, and I'm a believer in science.
Learning from history can always give me something to think about,
make me a less simple, less naive person.
